A. Find list of Airports operating in the Country India


select name from airport 
where country="India"

#########################################
select * from airport
where trim(upper(country))="INDIA";
#########################################

There are a total of 140 Airports Operating in India

B.	Find the list of Airlines having zero stops

select distinct a.airline , a.name
from airlines a
left outer join routes r 
on a.airline = r.airline_id
where r.stops = 0;


######################################
select distinct name
from airlines a
join routes r  (not left outer join)
on a.airline_id = r.airline_id
where r.stops = 0;

######################################


There are a total of 540 Airlines having zero stops 

C.	List of Airlines operating with code share


select distinct a.airline , a.name
from airlines a
left join routes r
on a.airline = r.airline_id
where r.codeshare = "Y";

###################################
select distinct a.airline , a.name
from airlines a
left join routes r
on a.airline = r.airline_id
where trim(upper(r.codeshare)) = "Y";
###################################

There are a total of 146 Airlines operating with code share agreement.

D.	Which country (or) territory having highest Airports


select country , count(*) as total_airport
from airport
group by country
order by total_airport desc
limit 5;

But the problem in my solution there could be multiple country having same no. of 
airports so either you could use rank() function or could use subquery to get that
highest airport number now that number can be common among all the country.

########################################################
select max(total) 
from (select count(airport_id) as total
from airport
group by country) abc  <-You have to use table name here
######################################################## It will give o/p 1697 airports

select country , count(airport_id) as total
from airport
group by country
having total in (select max(total) 
from (select count(airport_id) as total
from airport
group by country) abc)

########################################################

United States has 1697 airport which is at top


Q. Find list of countries having minimum airport.

select country , count(airport_id) as total
from airport
group by country
having total in (select min(total) 
from (select count(airport_id) as total
from airport
group by country) abc) 

So there are total of 34 countries having only 1 Airport


E.	Find the list of Active Airlines in United States


select distinct a.name
from routes r
join airlines a
on a.airline = r.airline_id
join airport arp1
on r.source_airport_id = arp1.airport_id
join airport arp2
on r.destination_airport_id = arp2.airport_id
where a.iata in (select r1.airline from routes r1) and
(arp1.country = "United States" or arp2.country = "United States");

There are 134 Active Airlines operating in the country. (Wrong)


select distinct a.name
from airlines a
join routes r
on a.airline = r.airline_id 
join airport ar1
on ar1.airport_id = r.source_airport_id
join airport ar2
on ar2.airport_id = r.destination_airport_id
where trim(upper(ar1.country)) = 'UNITED STATES' or
      trim(upper(ar2.country)) = 'UNITED STATES';
